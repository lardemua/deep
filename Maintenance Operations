* Reset mike password

* Installed docker as root
* Followed instructions from: https://en.opensuse.org/Docker
** sudo zypper install docker python3-docker-compose
** sudo systemctl enable docker
** sudo usermod -G docker -a $USER
** sudo systemctl restart docker
** Found this error:
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/version":
 dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

* did the following:

* Due to problems running carla docker container (issue [#8](https://github.com/lardemua/deep/issues/8)), I had to add more permissions to gpu devices (https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/657)

* Due to latency issues (issue [#8](https://github.com/lardemua/deep/issues/8)), I installed a USB-Ethernet adapter and configured the ethernet interface eth1 pasting the following lines into /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1:

```
NAME='eth1'
BOOTPROTO='static'
ONBOOT='yes'
IPADDR='193.137.171.109/24'
MTU='1500'
STARTMODE='auto'
GATEWAY=193.137.171.254   
```

* and the following line into /etc/sysconfig/network/ifroutes-eth1:

```
default 	193.137.171.254
```
