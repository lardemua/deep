* Reset mike password

* Installed docker as root
* Followed instructions from: https://en.opensuse.org/Docker
** sudo zypper install docker python3-docker-compose
** sudo systemctl enable docker
** sudo usermod -G docker -a $USER
** sudo systemctl restart docker
** Found this error:
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/version":
 dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

* So, following the instructionss of 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket
* did the following:
** sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
* Edited /etc/group and added mike, DanielCoelho11 and pazevedo to docker group
